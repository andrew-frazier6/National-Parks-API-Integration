# Project #3

- UI Element and API integration
- Take a look.  https://andrew-frazier6.github.io/Project-3/

## Description

- The main function of the site is to have the hamburger icon work, allowing a sliding menu of options to appear.

## Visual Choices

- Normally a part of the readMe where I would include a screenshot, though I feel that I must describe simply why I chose the layout I did. At first I started thinking of creative design for side bars and such, though through MANY failed ideas I settled upon siplicity for the sake of content. A national park does not need a fancy design to represent itself. A national park is more than enough to stand alone

## Roadmap

- I had the idea, underneath the description content when clicking on an individual park, of integrating a google map that would then show the surroundings of the park on the map. I simply did not have the time to finish this but will look to do so in the near future

## Final feelings

- Although the site works and has basic functions, I am not fully satisfied. I intend on cleaning up the css of the "description box" so that the reading of the parks might be a little clearer and if possible, try to bring in the google map feature.
