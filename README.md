## National-Parks-API-Integration

- Take a Look https://andrew-frazier6.github.io/National-Parks-API-Integration/

## ABOUT

- The site was built with Javascript, HTML, CSS.

- The goal was to integrate an API with a UI. I chose the menu dropdown to display
  content

## VISUAL CHOICES

- At first I started thinking of creative design for side bars and such, though through MANY failed ideas I settled upon siplicity for the sake of content. A national park does not need a fancy design to represent itself. A national park is more than enough to stand alone.

- The layout is meant to be like a picture frame of the picture displayed. Thats how every national park should be remembered. Sometimes even impossible to encapsulate the beauty of a park in a picture.

## ROADMAP

- I plan on, eventually, finding a way to change the background picture to the national park that was clicked on in the menu as well as displaying the information provided from the api. The href will still remain in case someone wants to visit the site. I also would not mind integrating a google map feature since the api has lat and long.

## Final feelings

- Although the site works and has basic functions, I am not fully satisfied. I intend on cleaning up many features and fine tuning my skills.
